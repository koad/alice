# Alice's packages folder

The `packages` folder within Alice's koad:io installation contains user interface components and packages written for Meteor/Blaze. These packages are designed to enhance the functionality and visual appearance of Alice's interface, allowing her to create engaging and interactive user experiences.

## Overview

Alice's `packages` folder serves as a repository for Meteor packages that are specifically tailored to her needs and preferences. It consists of two subfolders: `~/.koad-io/packages` and `~/.alice/packages`. The former contains packages provided by the koad:io framework, while the latter contains packages that Alice has customized or created herself.

When Alice utilizes a package, koad:io first checks the `~/.alice/packages` folder to see if there is a package with the same name. If a matching package is found in `~/.alice/packages`, it takes precedence over the one in `~/.koad-io/packages`. This allows Alice to have full control and customization over the packages she uses within her koad:io installation.

## Usage

To use the packages stored in Alice's `packages` folder, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Packages**: Locate the `~/.alice/packages` and `~/.koad-io/packages` folders within Alice's koad:io installation.

2. **Package Installation**: If you have custom packages that you want to use, place them in the `~/.alice/packages` folder. If you want to utilize the koad:io provided packages, place them in the `~/.koad-io/packages` folder. Each package should be placed in its own separate subfolder for organization.

3. **Package Naming**: Make sure that the packages in both folders have unique names. If a package exists in both `~/.alice/packages` and `~/.koad-io/packages` with the same name, the one in `~/.alice/packages` will take precedence.

4. **Import Packages**: Once the packages are placed in the respective folders, you can import them within your Meteor application using the standard `import` statement. Specify the package name along with the desired components or functionality you want to use.

   ```javascript
   import { ComponentName } from 'package-name';
   ```

5. **Utilize the Package**: Once the package is imported, you can leverage its features and components within your Meteor application. Refer to the package's documentation or examples to understand how to utilize its capabilities effectively.

Please note that the packages within Alice's `packages` folder are tailored to her specific needs and preferences. While you can utilize these packages as a reference or starting point, you may need to modify or customize them to suit your own requirements.
