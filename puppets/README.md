# Alice's Puppet

Welcome to the `puppets` folder of Alice's koad/io installation repository! This folder contains the puppets that Alice uses to interact with external websites and services. Puppets are instrumental in enabling Alice to automate tasks, retrieve data, and perform actions on behalf of users.

## Overview

Puppets in the `puppets` folder are scripts or modules that serve as automation agents. They allow Alice to interact with specific websites or services by simulating user actions, scraping data, or making API calls. These puppets are designed to handle the intricacies of each external service and provide seamless integration with Alice's koad/io environment.

## Usage

To utilize a puppet, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `puppets` folder within your koad/io installation.

2. Identify the puppet script or module that corresponds to the website or service you want to interact with. For example, if you want to interact with Spotify, you would use the `spotify.js` puppet.

3. Customize the puppet script or module according to your specific requirements. Each puppet may have different configuration options or parameters that you can modify to suit your needs. Consult the documentation or comments within the puppet script or module for guidance on customization.

4. Integrate the puppet into your Alice environment by referencing it in your commands, scripts, or other components. Puppets are designed to be used within the koad/io ecosystem and can be accessed and invoked from various parts of Alice's installation.

5. Execute the puppet to perform the desired actions or retrieve data from the external website or service. Puppets often utilize techniques like web scraping, API calls, or headless browser automation to interact with the target service. The puppet will handle the necessary authentication, navigation, and data retrieval processes for you.

It's important to note that when using puppets, you should adhere to the terms of service and policies of the target websites or services. Ensure that your usage complies with any restrictions or limitations set by the external service to maintain ethical and responsible automation practices.

## Puppet Examples

The `puppets` folder contains various examples of puppets that Alice has created to interact with different websites and services. Some examples include:

- **Spotify Puppet**: The `spotify.js` puppet allows Alice to log in as a user and perform actions on the Spotify platform, such as retrieving playlists, updating listening history, or interacting with the user's music library.

- **Twitter Puppet**: The `twitter.js` puppet enables Alice to post tweets, retrieve timelines, or perform other Twitter-related actions on behalf of a user.

- **GitHub Puppet**: The `github.js` puppet facilitates interaction with the GitHub platform, allowing Alice to perform tasks such as creating repositories, managing issues, or retrieving repository information.

These are just a few examples, and you can create custom puppets or extend existing ones to interact with additional websites or services based on your requirements.
