# Alice's browser folder

The `browser` folder in Alice's koad:io installation repository contains two subfolders: `profiles` and `extension`. These folders are related to Alice's browser-related functionality and extensions.

## Profiles

The `profiles` folder stores browser data directories that are created when using the `alice browse` command with specific websites or services. When Alice uses the `alice browse google.ca` command, for example, a browser data directory is created within the `profiles` folder to hold the browsing session data for Google Canada. These data directories allow Alice to manage and track her browsing activities on different websites or services separately.

## Extension

The `extension` folder houses Alice's Chrome extension, which users can install in their browsers. This extension serves as a tool for Alice to monitor and react to browser usage. It provides additional functionalities and interactions with the browser environment, allowing Alice to gather data, analyze user behavior, and automate certain tasks.

The extension acts as a bridge between the user's browsing activities and Alice's koad:io environment. It enables Alice to capture relevant information, perform actions based on user behavior, and integrate the browser experience into her overall workflow.

By installing the extension, users grant Alice permission to access and interact with their browsing sessions. This allows Alice to gain insights into their browsing habits, gather data for analysis, and provide personalized experiences or recommendations based on their browsing patterns.

## Usage

To use the browser-related features and extension, follow these steps:

1. **Installing the Extension**: To install Alice's Chrome extension, navigate to the `extension` folder and find the installation package specific to your browser. Follow the instructions provided to add the extension to your browser.

2. **Granting Permissions**: Once the extension is installed, it may request certain permissions or access to specific browser functionalities. Review the permissions and grant access as needed to allow Alice's extension to function properly.

4. **Managing Profiles**: When using the `alice browse` command with specific websites or services, a browser data directory is created within the `profiles` folder. These profiles help organize and manage Alice's browsing sessions on different websites. You can access these profiles to review or modify the data associated with each browsing session.

Please note that the extension and browser-related functionalities are designed to enhance Alice's capabilities and provide a more integrated browsing experience. It's important to review the permissions requested by the extension and ensure you are comfortable with the level of access granted to Alice.
