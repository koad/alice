# Alice's Browser Profiles

The `profiles` directory within Alice's koad:io `browser` folder stores browser data directories created during browsing sessions. Each profile represents a specific website or service that Alice interacts with using the `alice browse [ example.com ]` command.

## Usage

When Alice uses the `alice browse` command with a specific website or service, a new browser data directory is created within the `profiles` folder. This data directory holds the browsing session data, including cookies, cache, history, and other relevant information associated with that particular website or service.

To manage the browser profiles, follow these steps:

1. **Navigating to the Profiles Directory**: Locate the `profiles` folder within Alice's `browser` directory. It should be located at `~/.koad-io/browser/profiles`.

2. **Finding the Desired Profile**: Within the `profiles` directory, you will find individual folders named after the websites or services associated with the browsing profiles. Each folder represents a specific profile.

3. **Accessing Profile Data**: Enter the folder of the desired profile to access its corresponding data. You can explore the files and subdirectories within the profile folder to review the specific browsing session data.

4. **Managing Profiles**: You can delete or modify individual profile folders as needed. Be cautious when making changes, as deleting a profile will remove all the associated browsing session data.

## Purpose

The profiles directory is designed to allow Alice to separate and manage browsing session data for different websites or services. Each profile represents a distinct browsing context, preserving the cookies, cache, and history specific to that particular website or service.

By organizing the browsing data into separate profiles, Alice can maintain a clean and isolated environment for each website or service she interacts with. This helps prevent cross-site contamination and ensures that the browsing experience remains independent and secure for different online activities.
